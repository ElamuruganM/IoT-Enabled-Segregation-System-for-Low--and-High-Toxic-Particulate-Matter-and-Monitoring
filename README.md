# IoT Enabled Segregation System for Low- and High-Toxic Particulate Matter and Monitoring
An IoT-enabled twin fan-filter system separates highly toxic PM from low-toxic PM in real time, preventing cross-contamination. Only the small, high-toxicity fraction requires costly thermal or chemical treatment, while the rest goes to stabilization/solidification, greatly reducing disposal cost and improving urban PM management.
